Populate each section with information as it applies to your project. If a section does not apply, explain why. Include diagrams (or links to diagrams) in each section, as appropriate.  For example, sketches of the user interfaces along with an explanation of how the interface components will work; ERD diagrams of the database; rough class diagrams; context diagrams showing the system boundary; etc. Do _not_ link to your diagrams, embed them directly in this document by uploading the images to your GitHub and linking to them. Do _not_ leave any section blank.

# Program Organization

Stockbotics will be a simplistic and easy to use program that will allow investors to do mock trading and allow for 

[Model Designs]()

# Code Design

Stockbotics will be needing accounts that will branch down into investors and admins, these two inheritances will have the basic necessities of being able to create and own an account however the two will have different roles. Admins will be able to terminate investor accounts since they will have higher permissions.

# Data Design

Stockbotics uses a Firebase login, which is able to encorporate a seemless transition for login using a google authentication. We then will be encorporating APIs that will able to get live updates for our graph data to represent the stocks.

# Business Rules

You should list the assumptions, rules, and guidelines from external sources that are impacting your program design.

# User Interface Design

You should have one or more user interface screens in this section. Each screen should be accompanied by an explaination of the screens purpose and how the user will interact with it. You should relate each screen to one another as the user transitions through the states of your application. You should also have a table that relates each window or component to the support using stories.
